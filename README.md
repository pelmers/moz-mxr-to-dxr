[MXR to DXR](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/mxr-to-dxr/)
=========================

This Firefox addon does two things, which are both toggleable.

1. Rewrite all links to MXR to point to DXR instead.
2. Provide a toggle hotkey to switch between MXR and DXR.

An option is also provided to toggle between the staging and production DXR servers (dxr.m.o and dxr.a.o).
